			Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history. In one decade, he created nearly 2,100 pieces of art, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. <br>
			<br>
			Unfortunately, even though his work can be sold for hundred of thousands or even millions today, he was not commercially successful while he was alive. He struggled with severe depression and poverty. Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and he often neglected his health problems, by not eating properly and he drank heavily. This eventually lead to his suicide at age thirty-seven. <br>
			<br>
			Known the world over as one of the greats, Van Gogh has now an art gallery dedicated to honor and work in the Museum Square, Amsterdam South, Netherlands. Founded in 1963 by the Dutch Government, the museum itself was not opened until 1973 after constrution finished. It was renovated in 1998/1999 and an exhibition wing was added. The museum is home to the largest collection of Van Gogh's art work. It contains around 200 paintings, 400 drawings and 700 letters. His work is characterised by bold colours, dramatic, impulive & expressive brush work.
