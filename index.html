		There are so many different artists trying to make it in the world 	today, most of whom take inspriation from past artists like <span id = "names"> Manet, Monet</span> or <span id = "names">Van Gogh </span>, or one of his his contemporaries like <span id = "names">Gaughan</span>. <br><br>Being a fan of <span id = "names">Vincent Van Gogh</span> is a privillage more than anything else. His work has influenced many of my own paintings and his use of colour and big bold strokes laid the ground work for many artists who followed.
